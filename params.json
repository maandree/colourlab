Anypony that have tried\r\nto correct the colour courves for their flat screens will notice that is\r\nseems impossible, I therefore believe in the claim that they have logistic\r\ncurves (S-curves); and all software corrects gamma curves which CRT\r\nmonitores used. Therefore mathematical modelling contibutors must use\r\ngamma correct CRT monitors.\r\n\r\nsRGB(188,188,188) is the encoding of 50 % grey intensity (intensity is\r\nnot percepted!) so a 50â€“50 blend of sRGB(0, 0, 0) and sRGB(255, 255, 255)\r\nshould look like sRGB(188,188,188) if the individual pixels cannot be\r\ndiscerned. This is also true for primary colours, for example sRGB(0, 0, 0)\r\n+ sRGB(255, 0, 0) ~ sRGB(188, 0, 0).\r\nFurther sRGB(255, 255, 255) is definied as white (CIE white point D65),\r\nfade from blended sRGB(0, 0, 0) and sRGB(255, 255, 255) to pure\r\nsRGB(188, 188, 188) should look like a flat grey if the individual pixels\r\ncannot be discerned.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
