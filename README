Free mathemetical perceptual colour model


=== Important notes on monitor colour callibration for contributors. ===

To my knowledge their is not way, for any graphical systems of any kind,
to correct the colour courves for flat screens. Anypony that have tried
to correct the colour courves for their flat screens will notice that is
seems impossible, I therefore believe in the claim that they have logistic
curves (S-curves); and all software corrects gamma curves which CRT
monitores used. Therefore mathematical modelling contibutors must use
gamma correct CRT monitors.

sRGB(188,188,188) is the encoding of 50 % grey intensity (intensity is
not percepted!) so a 50â€“50 blend of sRGB(0, 0, 0) and sRGB(255, 255, 255)
should look like sRGB(188,188,188) if the individual pixels cannot be
discerned. This is also true for primary colours, for example sRGB(0, 0, 0)
+ sRGB(255, 0, 0) ~ sRGB(188, 0, 0).
Further sRGB(255, 255, 255) is definied as white (CIE white point D65),
fade from blended sRGB(0, 0, 0) and sRGB(255, 255, 255) to pure
sRGB(188, 188, 188) should look like a flat grey if the individual pixels
cannot be discerned.
